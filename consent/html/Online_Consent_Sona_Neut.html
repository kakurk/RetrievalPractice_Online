<p><b>Informed Consent to be in Study:</b></p>

<p>Online studies of memory and cognition</p>

<p id = "researcher"><b>Researcher: </b>Maureen Ritchey, Ph.D.</p>

<p><b>Please read the following information carefully before deciding whether to
  participate in this experiment.</b></p>

</div>

<div id="text">

<p>You are being asked to be in a research study of human memory and cognition
  and how these processes are implemented in the brain because you are an adult
  over the age of 18.</p>

<p>The purpose of this study is to investigate how you process, learn, or remember
information. To do so, we have developed behavioral tasks that test different
cognitive processes by measuring decisions that you make and how long it takes
to make them.</p>

<p>If you decide to volunteer, we will ask you fill out a demographic form prior
  to starting the experiment. Completion of this form is optional. No identifying
  information will be collected as part of this online research study. Your data will
  be linked to a code, which may be able to be used to identify you. However, keys
  to identities will be kept entirely separate from the experimental data in
  password-protected computers.</p>

<p>In this study, you will see/hear pictures, sounds, videos, sentences and/or words
  shown to you on your computer. You will be asked to make decisions about what
  you see or hear and to make responses to the stimuli by either pressing a button
  or by making a short written response.</p>

<!-- remember to enter the time it takes to complete the study!!! -->
<p>The study will take 45 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>There are no direct benefits to you, but you may feel gratified in knowing
  that you helped further the scholarly work in this research area. Choosing to
  be in this study is voluntary. If you choose not to be in this study, it will
  not affect your current or future relations with the University, and there is
  no penalty or loss of benefits. You are free to quit at any time, for whatever
  reason.</p>

<p>The risks of participating in this study are minimal. The visual and auditory
   stimuli will not be painful or damaging. A possible discomfort is that you
   may feel fatigued after a long study. If you become upset or frustrated by
   the experiment, we encourage you to take breaks, and you can withdraw from
   the study at any time. There may be other risks that are unknown at this
   time.</p>

<p>You will be compensated 1 psychology research credit per hour of testing. You
  will be compensated at the end of the your participation in the study. If you
  choose to withdraw early from the study, any credit or monetary compensation
  will be adjusted for the amount of time that was spent in study.</p>

<p><b>Data Sharing:</b></p>

<ul>

  <li>The data from this study might be used for future research projects in
    addition to the study you are currently participating in. Those future
    projects may focus on a topic that is unrelated to the goals of this study.
    We will give access to the data we are collecting to the general public and
    research community via the Internet and a fully open database. </li>

  <li>The data we share with the general public will be coded and not have your
    name on it, so people will not know your name or which data are yours. In
    addition, we will not share any information that we think might help people
    who know you guess which data are yours. If we write a report or article
    about this study or share the study data set with others, we will do so in
    a way that, to the best of our knowledge, ensures you cannot be directly
    identified.</li>

  <li>By agreeing to participate, you will be making a free and generous gift
    for research that might help others. It is possible that some of the
    research conducted using your information eventually could lead to the
    development of new methods for studying brain, new diagnostic tests, new
    drugs or other commercial products. Should this occur, there is no plan to
    provide you with any part of the profits generated from such products and
    you will not have any ownership rights in the products.</li>

  <li>Letting us use and share your data is voluntary. If you are not
    comfortable with the unlikely risk of being identified through your data,
    please withdraw from this study. You do not need to tell us why you are
    withdrawing. You are able to withdraw at any point throughout the study.
    By signing below, you agree to provide your data for future research. You
    agree that these may be shared with other investigators at other
    institutions from around the world. The details, results, and implications
    of these studies are unknown.</li>
